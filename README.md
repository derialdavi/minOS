# Kernel development
This repository follows the book [operating-system-in-1000-lines](https://operating-system-in-1000-lines.vercel.app/en/) which implements a basic operating system. Once I've learned how to develop this basic OS, I'll try to implement missing features, described in section 3.

## Requirements
- `bash`
- `tar`
- c compiler
- `lld`
- `llvm` package (`llvm-objcopy`, `llvm-objdump`, `llvm-readelf`)
- `qemu-system-riscv32`
